## Things I want to focus on in my site
- I need to flesh out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}notes/13-Goals">13 Goals</a> and pull those from my other documents
- I need to start collecting ideas that come up throughout the week in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}notes/11-Collect">11 Collect</a> area. From there the ideas that have gelled should be moved to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}notes/14-Ideas">14 Ideas</a>
