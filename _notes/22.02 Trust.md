# Developing Trust
- Establish expectations early and be accountable to them
- Be willing to stand up for your reports
- Find ways for reports to do work that inspires them even if it isn't with your department

# Signs of Trust
1. Reports regularly bring their biggest challenges to your attention.
2. Reports and you can regularly bring each other critical feedback and it isn't taken personally.
3. Reports would gladly work for you again
