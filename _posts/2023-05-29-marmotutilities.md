## Description
This application uses python and flask. The purpose of the app is to create a easy way for users to interact with SQL and db files in a way that saves them from needing to have experience with SQL queries.
Currently I have built a utility that searches a db file containing loan rules from the library circulation system, Sierra. This search allows a user to quickly find the loan rule that would apply for a specific patron and item combination at their library. This utility was inspired by the work of Jeremy Goldstein at the Minuteman Library Network.
