## Description 
This is the project I completed for my senior seminar class for my Bachelor's degree. It utilizes Strava's API to allow Discord users to pull relevant stats for their activities they have completed in Strava. In the first iteration of this project I just programmed commands relevant for cycling activities completed in Strava.

## Code Technologies Used
- Python
- REST API
- Discord Bot framework
